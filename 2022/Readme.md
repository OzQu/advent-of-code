### Rust + ChatGPT

2022 tasks I'm mostly implementing with the help of ChatGPT v3.5 (and v4). 
I try to ask help from ChatGPT in a simplified way and maybe point it to make better judgement calls and use better approaches if I recognize that it is doing something "not perfectly".
Kinda using it as pair coding fella.
